      <p class="center-disciplines">COMPUTER ENGINEERING</p> 
      <p class="additional-text">Computer engineering is a field that bridges the gap between the hardware focus of electrical engineering and the software focus of computer science. Computer engineers design hardware, particularly processors for various systems, ranging from computers and smartphones to automobiles and space vehicles. They focus on what the hardware aims to achieve rather than the intricate details of its components. They also design specialized processors like GPUs and hardware for AI acceleration. A key area of interest for computer engineers is the connections between devices, with an emphasis on the protocols used for data transmission rather than the physical aspects of the connections.</p>
      <p class="center-disciplines">COMPUTER SCIENCE</p> 
      <p class="additional-text">Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It is a broad field which includes everything from the algorithms that make up software to how software interacts with hardware to how well software is developed and designed. Computer scientists use various mathematical algorithms, coding procedures, and their expert programming skills to study computer processes and develop new software and systems.</p>
      <p class="center-disciplines">INFORMATION SYSTEM</p>
      <p class="additional-text">information systems refer to the networks, hardware, and software that individuals and businesses use to interpret, collect, process, and distribute data. They are crucial for businesses as they support decision-making, management tasks, and customer interactions. Information systems are used in various business functions, such as analyzing supply chains, processing financial data, and automating tasks. They are also essential for the operation of personal computers, cloud computing, social networks, and internet-based organizations like Google and eBay.</p>
      <p class="center-disciplines">INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</p> 
      <p class="additional-text">Information technology (IT) is the use of computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to the technology used for personal or entertainment purposes. The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.</p>
      <p class="center-disciplines">SOFTWARE ENGINEER</p> 
      <p class="additional-text">Software engineering is a branch of computer science focused on the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers use engineering principles and programming knowledge to create software solutions, including computer games, business applications, operating systems, and network control systems. This career offers opportunities in various industries, including businesses, government agencies, nonprofits, and healthcare. As technology evolves, the demand for software engineers grows, with more companies offering remote work options, increasing flexibility and entry into the field.</p>
