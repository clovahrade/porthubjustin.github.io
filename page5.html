        <p class="center-text">TYPES OF MOTHERBOARDS</p>
        <p class="additional-text">Motherboards are the heart of any computer, connecting all the key components like the CPU, memory, and storage to make everything work together. Choosing the right type of motherboard can make a big difference in performance, compatibility, and even the size of your build. This study takes a closer look at the most common types of motherboards, breaking down their features to help you understand their strengths and weaknesses. </p>
        <p class="additional-text">Not all motherboards are created equal—they vary in size, build quality, and what they’re designed to do. Some are perfect for powerful gaming rigs or professional workstations, while others are better for small, space-saving systems like IoT devices. For example, ATX motherboards are a go-to choice for high-performance setups because of their expandability, while Mini ITX boards are ideal when you need something compact. </p>
        <p class="additional-text">Here are some key features to consider when comparing motherboards: 
          <br>•	Form Factor: <br>This determines the size of the motherboard and which computer cases it will fit into. 
          <br>•	CPU and Memory Slots: <br>These tell you how many processors and sticks of RAM the motherboard can support. 
          <br>•	Chipsets and BIOS: <br>These play a big role in what the motherboard can do, from running high-end hardware to adding features and stability. 
          <br>•	Connectivity: Look at <br>the number of PCI slots, SATA ports, and built-in extras like WiFi or Bluetooth to make sure the motherboard meets your needs.
