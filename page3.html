        <p class="center-text">NUMBER SYSTEM</p>
        <p class="additional-text">A number system is defined as a system of writing to express numbers. It is the mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. It provides a unique representation of every number and represents the arithmetic and algebraic structure of the figures. It also allows us to operate arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p>
        <p class="center-disciplines">NUMBER</p> 
        <p class="additional-text">A number is a mathematical value used for counting, measuring, or labeling objects, and for performing arithmetic. Examples include natural, whole, rational, and irrational numbers, with 0 representing a null value. Numbers can also be classified as even, odd, prime, or composite. Even numbers are divisible by 2, while prime numbers have only two factors. In number systems, digits like 0 and 1 are used for binary numbers, and digits 0 to 9 are used in other systems.</p>
        <p class="center-disciplines">TYPES OF NUMBER SYSTEM AND ITS USES</p> 
        <p class="additional-text2">DECIMAL</p>
        <p class="additional-text">A number system with a base value of 10 is termed a Decimal number system. It uses 10 digits i.e. 0-9 for the creation of numbers. Here, each digit in the number is at a specific place with a place value of a product of different powers of 10. Here, the place value is termed from right to left as the first place value called units, second to the left as Tens, so on Hundreds, Thousands, etc. Here, units have a place value of 100, tens have a place value of 101, hundreds as 102, thousands as 103, and so on.</p>
        <p class="additional-text">Digits: <br>0-9<br>
          Uses:<br>
          Everyday Arithmetic: <br>The most widely used number system for daily calculations and transactions, such as shopping, accounting, and measurements.
          <br>Commerce and Banking:<br> Decimal is used for financial records, tax systems, and other monetary calculations.
          Education: The decimal system is foundational for teaching basic arithmetic and mathematical concepts.
          </p>

        <p class="additional-text2">BINARY</p>
        <p class="additional-text">A number System with a base value of 2 is termed a Binary number system. It uses 2 digits i.e. 0 and 1 for the creation of numbers. The numbers formed using these two digits are termed Binary Numbers. The binary number system is very useful in electronic devices and computer systems because it can be easily performed using just two states ON and OFF i.e. 0 and 1.Decimal Numbers 0-9 are represented in binary as 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, and 1001</p>
        <p class="additional-text">Digits: <br>0, 1<br>
          Uses:<br>
          Computing and Digital Electronics: <br>Binary is the backbone of computer systems, where data and instructions are represented using bits (0s and 1s). All processing in CPUs, memory, and storage devices happens in binary.
          <br>Digital Logic Circuits: <br>Binary is used to represent on (1) and off (0) states in logic gates.
          <br>Programming and Networking: <br>Binary is crucial in low-level programming, network protocols, and error detection methods.
          </p>
        <p class="additional-text2">OCTAL</p>
        <p class="additional-text">Octal Number System is one in which the base value is 8. It uses 8 digits i.e. 0-7 for the creation of Octal Numbers. Octal Numbers can be converted to Decimal values by multiplying each digit with the place value and then adding the result. Here the place values are 80, 81, and 82. Octal Numbers are useful for the representation of UTF8 Numbers.</p>
        <p class="additional-text">Digits: <br>0-7<br>
          Uses:<br>
          Legacy Computing Systems: <br>Octal was once commonly used in early computer systems (like PDP-11) for programming and addressing. Although less common today, itâ€™s still found in certain systems.
          <br>Unix File Permissions: <br>Octal is used in Unix-based systems to represent file permissions, where each digit represents read, write, and execute permissions for user, group, and others.
          <br>Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems: <br>In specific low-level hardware programming, octal is sometimes used for ease of representation.
          </p>

        <p class="additional-text2">HEXADECIMAL</p>
        <p class="additional-text">A number System with a base value of 16 is known as Hexadecimal Number System. It uses 16 digits for the creation of its numbers. Digits from 0-9 are taken like the digits in the decimal number system but the digits from 10-15 are represented as A-F i.e. 10 is represented as A, 11 as B, 12 as C, 13 as D, 14 as E, and 15 as F. Hexadecimal Numbers are useful for handling memory address locations.</p>
        <p class="additional-text">Digits: <br>0-9, A-F<br>
          Uses:<br>
          Computer Science and Programming: <br>Hexadecimal is frequently used to represent binary data more compactly. It simplifies reading and interpreting long binary sequences (e.g., memory addresses and color codes in web design).
          <br>Assembly Language and Low-Level Programming: <br>Used to represent machine instructions and memory locations in a more readable format.
          <br>Cryptography: <br>Hexadecimal is often used in encryption algorithms and hash functions for digital security.
